# n7m (neuronym)

`n7m` is a library for working with [neuronyms](http://www.i18nguy.com/origini18n.html) like `i18n`, `k8s`, or `w9k`.

If you've ever thought "infrastructure engineers sure like to make their work sound important by introducing stupid jargon," this library might help you out.

More than anything, this is a simple project for me to improve my Rust.
